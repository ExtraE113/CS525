My implementation can be compiled and run.

Lambda calculus implementations of 8 queen, list permute, and word dublets 
can be found in the appropriately named files in `/Examples/`.

Some test code is commented out to make reading the output cleaner/easier to read,
but feel free to uncomment it.

To run the code, just compile and run the appropriate file.
